In every case , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- bound as well as or more tightly -LRB- i . e . , had a lower K D -LSB- equilibrium dissociation constant -RRB- than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from > > 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from > > 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW -LRB- Table 3 and Fig . 1 -RRB- . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution -LRB- less than 1.7 - fold -RRB- . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by > 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA -LRB- with aTatposition 12 -RRB- indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position -LRB- 36 -RRB- , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue -LRB- see the Discussion for a fuller treatment -RRB- . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation -LRB- see above -RRB- . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- -LRB- with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89G -RRB- -LRB- with no side chain -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89D -RRB- -LRB- with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89V -RRB- -LRB- with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , -RRB- , WT SoxS , and SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- were introduced into these fusions and assayed for β - galactosidase . Again -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA -LRB- Fig . 3 -RRB- . Similarly , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive -LRB- indistinguishable from the control plasmid -RRB- for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- was still more active than WT MarA . -LRB- The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . -RRB- As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , -LRB- i -RRB- that variant E89D is virtually inactive , -LRB- ii -RRB- that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , -LRB- iii -RRB- that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and -LRB- iv -RRB- that SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated -LRB- see Materials and Methods -RRB- . Again -LRB- Fig . 2 and Table 3 -RRB- , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox -LRB- Fig . 4 -RRB- . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 -LRB- Fig . 4A and B -RRB- . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA -LRB- Fig . 4B -RRB- . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream -LRB- between positions 9 and 10 -RRB- was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed -LRB- Fig . 4 -RRB- although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels -LRB- Table 2 ; see also below -RRB- . For the nine class II promoters , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - -LRB- Q91 -RRB- has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence -LRB- 36 -RRB- . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site -LRB- Q85 -RRB- in SoxS -LRB- 16 -RRB- . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- relative to MarA -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- to the micF marbox -LRB- using protein without the His 6 tag -RRB- showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- to activate the class II micF promoter -LRB- 13 -RRB- . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate -LRB- PMS -RRB- and menadione -LRB- Table 4 -RRB- . Cells constitutively expressing MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS -LRB- 1.7 - fold -RRB- and , to a lesser extent , to menadione -LRB- 1.3 - fold -RRB- . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS -LRB- MIC of 35 μM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA -RRB- but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione -LRB- MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT -RRB- . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant -LRB- acrAB , tolC , and micF -RRB- and that defend against superoxide stress -LRB- e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf -RRB- -LRB- 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 -RRB- . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated -LRB- 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 -RRB- . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure -LRB- Fig . 5 -RRB- shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the β - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small `` clash '' -LRB- as predicted by the MolProbity program -LSB- http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / -RSB- -RRB- between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone .	in every case , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- bind as well as or more tightly -lrb- i . e . , have a lower k d -lsb- equilibrium dissociation constant -rrb- than wt mara . for several promoter marbox this change be dramatic : the k d drop from > > 150 to 50 for inaa , from 200 to 75 for nfsb , and from > > 150 nm to ~ 100 nm for both ybjc and yhbw . in spite of this , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- activation be greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjc ; it be comparable to that of WT MarA for micf and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdab , nfsb , and ybhw -lrb- Table 3 and fig . 1 -rrb- . we conclude that the WT glutamic acid of mara at position 89 be a inhibitor of mara binding to many marbox . in a effort to understand why e89 be inhibitory , we examine the sequence of the 14 marbox for which we have datum -lrb- Table 3 -rrb- . we notice that five haveatatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequence be increase by the e89a substitution -lrb- less than 1.7 - fold -rrb- . in contrast , of the remain nine sequence that do not have atatthis position , the binding of e89a be increase for six of they by > 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increase binding . although the cocrystal structure of mara with the marrab marbox dna -lrb- with atatposition 12 -rrb- indicate no interaction between the two molecule at this position -lrb- 36 -rrb- , we consider the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox dna and mara could limit activation by mara when position 12 be not a t residue -lrb- see the discussion for a fuller treatment -rrb- . to examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of e89 sterically inhibit interaction with marbox dna lack atatposition 12 , we test the effect of several amino acid substitution at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacz fusion and the mdtg : : lacz fusion , the two fusion that show the greatest effect of e89a on activation -lrb- see above -rrb- . Plasmids carry WT MarA , the mara variant mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- -lrb- with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89g -rrb- -lrb- with no side chain -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89d -rrb- -lrb- with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89v -rrb- -lrb- with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of soxs and have a dimethyl methylene side chain , -rrb- , wt soxs , and soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- be introduce into these fusion and assay for β - galactosidase . Again -lrb- Table 2 -rrb- , activation of these promoter by soxs be much greater than that by mara -lrb- fig . 3 -rrb- . similarly , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- be considerably more active than wt mara . in contrast , the e89d variant be less active than wt mara for fpr and completely inactive -lrb- indistinguishable from the control plasmid -rrb- for mdtg . e89g be approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtg although for both promoter it be considerably less active than e89a . the e89v variant be marginally more active than the WT for both promoter but substantially less so than e89a . soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- reduce the activation of these promoter relative to wt soxs , but soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- be still more active than wt mara . -lrb- the activation show here be greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmid carry mara , soxs , and they mutant be not entirely shut off by laci q so that the increase express in Table 2 appear smaller . -rrb- as outline in the Discussion , these result , namely , -lrb- i -rrb- that variant e89d be virtually inactive , -lrb- ii -rrb- that e89g be very active although to a lesser extent than e89a , -lrb- iii -rrb- that e89v be only marginally more active than the WT , and -lrb- iv -rrb- that soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- have reduce activation although not to the low level express by WT MarA , be consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of e89 sterically inhibit interaction with the dna for marbox sequence lack atat position 12 . if , as outline above and present in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between position 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 be responsible for the very poor activation of promoter such as fpr , then it would be predict that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhance if that phosphate be absent . we therefore compare the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - strand dna contain the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsdna of the same sequence and length but prepare so that the phosphate linkage between position 12 and 13 of the marbox be eliminate -lrb- see Materials and method -rrb- . Again -lrb- Fig . 2 and Table 3 -rrb- , mara bind very poorly to the fpr marbox -lrb- fig . 4 -rrb- . however , binding increase significantly when the fpr dna lack the phosphate group between position 12 and 13 -lrb- fig . 4a and b -rrb- . in contrast , soxs bind more tightly to dsdna than to the discontinuous dna -lrb- fig . 4b -rrb- . when the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream -lrb- between position 9 and 10 -rrb- be absent , no significant alteration in binding be observe -lrb- fig . 4 -rrb- although a small increase be observe when the phosphate between position 15 and 16 be absent . we conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibit the ability of mara to bind . activation and marbox binding by mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- . the only other mara mutation find here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class i promoter be q91a -lrb- Table 2 -rrb- . of the seven class i promoter examine , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- activate the acrab , marrab , and zwf promoter to similar extent as WT MarA but activate acna , fpr , mdtg , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT level -lrb- Table 2 ; see also below -rrb- . for the nine class ii promoter , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- significantly reduce the activation of fumc , inaa , micf , pqia , and ybjc but have no significant effect on nfsb , mdab , soda , oryhbw . mara - -lrb- q91 -rrb- have be identify as form van der waals interaction with the methyl group of the two thymidine that be complementary to the adenine at position 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence -lrb- 36 -rrb- . thus , it would be expect that the q91a substitution might reduce activation of the seven class ii promoter that have at least one a at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoter , nfsb and soda , that have no a residue at these position . indeed , nfsb and soda be among the promoter that q91a activate to the same extent as WT MarA . since q91a reduce the expression of four of the seven class i promoter and four of the nine class ii promoter , we result be inconsistent with the proposition that q91 be principally require for interaction at class ii promoter , as have be propose for the analogous site -lrb- q85 -rrb- in soxs -lrb- 16 -rrb- . for the majority of these promoter , the gel mobility assay for binding of mara to marbox be insufficiently precise to determine whether there be a correlation between binding and activation by mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- relative to mara -lrb- Table 3 -rrb- . among the class i promoter that exhibit measurable binding to mara , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- show no greater binding or activation for acrab , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtg and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marrab . a modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation be see for the class ii mdab promoter . although not observe in these experiment , a more detailed analysis of the binding of mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- to the micf marbox -lrb- use protein without the he 6 tag -rrb- show a very small reduction in bind concomitant with the reduce ability of mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- to activate the class ii micf promoter -lrb- 13 -rrb- . thus , relative to mara , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for q91a at class i promoter , but none be obvious with regard to the class ii promoter . activation of superoxide resistance by mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- . if the glutamic acid at position 89 of mara be a major determinant in vivo of the reduce activity of mara at many promoter where soxs be more active , we would expect cell carry mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- to be more resistant to superoxide than cell carry WT MarA . this be test with gradient plate assay of sensitivity to two superoxide - generate compound , phenazine methosulfate -lrb- pms -rrb- and menadione -lrb- Table 4 -rrb- . cell constitutively express mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- be more resistant than wt mara to pms -lrb- 1.7 - fold -rrb- and , to a lesser extent , to menadione -lrb- 1.3 - fold -rrb- . comparable mic with soxs for pm be 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . clearly , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- activate superoxide resistance to a greater extent than wt mara . curiously , the q91a substitution have no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator pms -lrb- mic of 35 μm for both the q91a mutant and the WT MarA -rrb- but lower resistance to the superoxide generator menadione -lrb- mic of 0.9 mm for the q91a mutant and 1.8 mm for the WT -rrb- . discussion . the mara - soxs - Rob regulon of e . coli consist of a variety of gene that enable cell to adapt to multiple stress . it contain gene that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant -lrb- acrab , tolc , and micf -rrb- and that defend against superoxide stress -lrb- e . g . , acna , fpr , fumc , nfsa , soda , and zwf -rrb- -lrb- 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 -rrb- . not surprisingly , there be quantitative difference in the extent of activation of particular promoter by the paralogous activator so that the phenotypic outcome depend on which activator be upregulate -lrb- 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 -rrb- . e89 inhibition . we have show here that the mara glutamic acid residue e89 be responsible for decrease the binding of WT MarA relative to soxs for the class i marbox promoter , acna , mdtg , fpr , and zwf , thereby decrease the relative activation of these promoter and hence the resistance engender to superoxide by mara . we think the follow may explain these result . a detail of the mara structure -lrb- fig . 5 -rrb- show that e89 be orient in the cocrystal with its acidic group expose to the solvent away from the dna backbone . in so do , methyl hydrogen on the β - and - carbon be positioned restrictively close to a oxygen of the phosphate group between basis t12 and g13 of the marrab marbox . even this orientation of e89 be only possible as the result of a small `` clash '' -lrb- as predict by the MolProbity program -lsb- http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / -rsb- -rrb- between e89 and s90 that permit the rotation of e89 into the mara core and away from the dna backbone .

From the JC7623 derivative -LRB- strain IMW40 -RRB- wifh fhe described phenotype , the disrupted IrbA was transferred by Pi transducfion to strain MC4100 to test growth and expression of nuo - iacZ fusions .

The hybridization pattern matched thaf expected for the parental strain -LRB- 4.6 kb fragment -RRB- and the IrhAwspc ' mutant -LRB- 6.6 kb fragment -RRB- . Southern hybridization of wild - type chromosomal DNA with a IrhA probe -LRB- Sft / i - EcoRV fragment of Fig . 1 -RRB- showed oniy one hybridizing band , demonstrating that only one IrhA copy is present in the E . co / / genome -LRB- not shown -RRB- . Effects of -LRB- rhA . . spc ' mutation on growtb and niio - iacZ expression Strain IMW41 witft the chromosomaily inactivated IrhA was analysed for growth wifh fermenfabie and non - fermentable substrates . With succinate and acetate as the carbon source , growth depends on respiration , mainly via NADH oxidation . Growth rate and growth yields of fhe mutanf were not . or only slightly , reduced compared with fhe wild type , both during aerobic growth with glucose or wifh nonfermenfable substrates -LRB- succinate , aoefate -RRB- -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- . Anaerobic growth by fumarafe or nifrate respirafion was also unaffected . Accordingly , the expression of nuogggAB ' - ' / acZ and of / luo ^ . / ^ - ' ^ S ' - ' / acZ was similar in both parental and mutant strains under respective conditions . Mufants in nuo are known to be affected in growth on acetate and amino acids -LRB- FruB et ai , 1994 -RRB- . Neither growth on these substrates nor expression of nuo was changed significantly in fhe IrbA mufants . Since only one copy of IriiA was present , it has to be concluded that IrhA and LrhA are not essential under fhe conditions tested and do not significantly affect nuo expression and respiratory -LRB- i . e . NADH oxidation - dependent -RRB- growth . Discussion Transcriptionai reguiation of the nuo genes : regufatory regjons , -LRB- ranscr / pf / ona / reguiators and effectors The expression of nuoAB -LRB- C -RRB- responds to the presence of eiectron acceptors , C4 dicarboxylates and to various transcriptional regulators . The maximal differences were obtained for growth by nitrafe respiration -LRB- H - as donor -RRB- and growth by fermenfafion . These were a 4.7 - fold repression for nuog ^ gAB ' - ' lacZ -LRB- complefe intergenic region upstream of nuo -RRB- and a 13.4 - fold repression for m / o ^ 77 / lB ' - / acZ -LRB- truncated intergenic region -RRB- under fermentative conditions . The reguiatory responses weve lower fhan those observed for other respiratory genes , e . g . nifrate or nitrite reductases -LRB- Showe and DeMoss , 1963 ; Jayaraman et ai , 1987 -RRB- . but for an essential enzyme -LRB- ike NADH : quinone oxidoreducfase , greafer responses are not expected . Comparison of the protein and operon fusions shows that the expression of nuo is regulated only al the transcriptiona ! and not at the franslatjonal level . Growth on substrates supplying high amounts of NADH , e . g . glucose or giycei ' ol , did nof stimulate nuo expression compared wifh growth with H : . or formate . The rationale could be achievement of maximal proton translocation and energy conservation under NADH - iimiting conditions . i . e . growth with H2 or formate . It is possible , too . that factors other than NADH contribute to supply the respective regulatory signal . This couid be eiflier fhe growth rate or C 1995 Blackwell Science Lid . Molecular Microbiology , 16 , 521 - 534Transcriptional regulation of Escherichia coii nuo genes 529 the infracellular NAD -LRB- P -RRB- H / NAD -LRB- P -RRB- ratio . How this ratio changes upon growth with different hydrogen donors is not known . Two distinct regulatory regions have been identified by dissection at base pair - 277 . The regions might correspond to the two franscripfional start sites detected here and future work has to show which transcriptional factors and signals can be related to each promoter . It is conceivable that the regulatory sifes controlling expression of fhe disfal promoter upstream of - 172 / 173 are not present on the short fusions nuo277 . This assumption could explain lhe different expression of nuo from the long -LRB- nuoe ^ e -RRB- and the short -LCB- nuo277 -RRB- fusions . The DNA region up to base pair - 277 is required for regulation by Oo and nitrate and fhe franscriptional reguiators ArcA . NarL . FNR and IHF . The main effecf was an anaerobic repression by ArcA and a nitrate stimulation by NarL . FNR repressed slightly , and possibly indirectly , during anaerobic growth . Centred around - 113bp , a sequence -LRB- AATGGTGTTGA - TATT -RRB- wilh some simiiarity to the IHF - consensus YAACTTNTTGATTTW -LRB- Y , CU ; W , MJ -RRB- is found -LRB- Goodrich et ai , 1990 -RRB- . This site shares fhe TTGAT sequence with the potential FNR consensus around base pair - 107 . Therefore , via the shared sequences , competition between IHF and FNR might occur , as demonstrated by fhe enhanced nuo expression in the bimO fnr double mutant . iHF and FNH may function as repressors competing for overlapping sites , or either of the factors may enhance ArcA - dependent repression . Other promoters responding fo ArcA and NarL in combination have not been described so far , whereas various promoters regulated by FNR and NarL -LRB- Jones and Gunsalus , 1987 ; Sfewarf . 1982 ; Li and Stewart , 1992 -RRB- or ArcA and FNR are known -LRB- Sawers and Suppmann , 1992 ; Hassan and Sun , 1992 : Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 -RRB- . In future studies , the sites essential for ArcA and NarL action should be identified by deletion analysis to yield more information on ArcA and NarL interaction . The region upstream of - 277 was required for a new regulatory effect : the transcriptional stimulation by C ^ dicarboxylates and some other factors both under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions . The corresponding regulators and regulatory sites are nof known so far . LrhA , a presumed regulafor of the LysR family , is not essential for the transoripfional regulation of nuo . Since most of the regulators of the LysR family are located adjacent to the target genes , the region of XY -RSB- e E . coii genome beyond the \ S1 element could contain unknown target genes of LrhA -LRB- Rudd , 1992 -RRB- .	the sequencing reaction -lsb- iane t , g , c , a -rrb- be perform witb tbe same primer and plasmid pyb3 . , c - 1995 Blackwell Science Ltd , molecular Microbiology , 16 . 521 - 534transcriptional regulation of escherichia coli nuo gene 527 genr cfxr geiir cfxfi genr cfxr helix turn - helix r s pa 5x -lrb- a -rrb- hplnplrxfxxhxpppphsxaapxlpht -lrb- jstfitrqhpplepxlg > wlfxrxprxhxxxtx I I I IP I I I ii 11 m i n i m l l l l l I l l l l hisanrplifjldldllrtfvavadlntfaaaaaavcrtasavsqahqrleqlvgkelfarhgrnkllteh -lrb- 70 -rrb- * * * * * * * * * * - k * * * * * * ^ * * * * * * * * * * a -lrb- b -rrb- giqllgyarkil . rfni -rrb- eacsslmfsn -- lqgvltigasdesadtilpfllnrvssvypklaldvrvkrna -lrb- 1.38 -rrb- gdrllmiiasrilgevkoaeeglqavkdveqgsitiglists - kyfapkllagftalmpgvdlriaegnile xxxxxlpxxphdhh 11 illll yuaehlesoevdlhvtthrpsafkaln -- lrrspfhwycaaeyilqkgepipl ulldopspfr -lrb- 199 -rrb- tllrllqdnaidlalhgrppreldavsepiaai - iphvlvaspuhplhdakgeuloelrhetfllrepgsgt -lrb- 206 -rrb- * * * * * * * * * * a -lrb- ud -rrb- fig . 7 . similarity of tine lrba protein with tbe iranscriptional regulator clxr of Alcaligene ^ s eutroplius -lcb- Windbovel and Bowien , 1991 -rrb- . identicai -lrb- * -rrb- and similar -lcb- . -rrb- amino acid residue be indicate . the upper line sliows consensus molif for dna binding -lrb- helix - liirnhelix motif -rrb- -lrb- a -rrb- , co - indiicer recognition -lrb- b -rrb- , and a c - terminal con . sensu . s domain -lrb- g -rrb- of lysr - lype regulator -lrb- Scbel ! , 1993 -rrb- , wbere ti stand ior bydrophobic residue -lrb- v , I , l , m -rrb- , p for polar residue -lrb- t . s .

I -RRB- NA fl ' om the plasmid was subcloned to isolate a small fragntent containing an active araFGH promoter Plasmid BEKI80 DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes HaeIII , FnudlI or Alul in separate reactions and HindIII linkers were added . The fl ' agments were ligated to the promoter vector pK01 , which places the galactokinase gene under control of the cloned promoter -LRB- McKenney et al . , 1982 -RRB- . The DNA was transformed into a GalK - strain and isolates were obtained that were Gal + only in tile presence of arabinose . A 1 '' 1 kb HiudIII fragment containing an arabinose dependent promoter was found in several candidates . Tile plasmid was cleaved with EcoRI nuelease to remove a 600 bp fragment upstream from the promoter producing tile plasmid pWH54 , which contains a 500 bp HindIII - EcoFCI fragment with the araFGH promoter . Sequence analysis showed that the HindIH linker had been added at an AluI site -LRB- Fig . 2 -RRB- . The Sequence of the araFGH operon has been determined by Scripture et al . -LRB- 1987 -RRB- . With few exceptions -LRB- see Discussion -RRB- our sequence matches the region from 12 to 518 bp upstream from the araF gene , confirming that pWH54 does contain the araFGH promoter . -LRB- c -RRB- Transcriptional start site of PFGx The start site of transcription in vivo was mapped by isolating cellular RNA and performing $ 1 assays using as a probe the 500 bp promoter fragments 5 ' labeled at the HindIII site .

Cellular RNA from strain pWH54 / SH313 was hybridized to the 500 bp PFGH probe 5 ' end - labeled at the HindIII site and subjected to S 1 nuclease analysis . Lanes A to D , DNA - RNA hybrids were digested with 5 units S 1 at 37 ° C . Cells were grown in M9 salts glycerol medium . and L - arabinose was added before harvesting for time : lane A , 0 min ; lane B , 7 min ; lane C , 30 min ; and lane D , 5 generations . Lanes E to G , cells were grown in the presence of arabinose for 5 generations and DNA - RNA hybrids incubated with : lane E , 40 units S 1 , 37 ° C ; lane F , 5 units S l , 45 ° C ; lane G , 5 units S t 32 ° C . Sequencing size markers , G + A and AC reactions , are shown at right ; the sequence of the top strand is indicated . of araFGH , since the HindIII end was added as a linker and will not hybridize . Therefore , the kinetics of induction of the operon were studied by growing cells containing the plasmid pWH54 in the presence or in the absence of arabinose . In the absence of arabinose , no signal was observed -LRB- Fig . 3 -RRB- . After an induction period of seven minutes very little transcript was produced , while after 30 minutes approximately one - half the maximal level of transcription was seen . When cells were grown for five generations -LRB- 600 rain -RRB- in arabinose , the maximum signal was obtained at one region that we have assigned + 1 . The signal contains a cluster of three adjacent bands , so the central band is proposed as the start site with an errror of ± l bp . No other apparent sites were observed when the digestion temperature was raised to 45 ° C or lowered to 32 ° C or when the level of S 1 nuclease was varied from 5 to 40 units per reaction . These data place the start of transcription l ll bases upstream from the first codon of the araF gene . -LRB- d -RRB- Transcription of araFGH in vitro To determine the requirements for transcription of this operon , we perform in vitro transcription experiments using purified AraC , CRP and RNA polymerase . The plasmid was linearized by cutting at the SmaI site at + 120 , and reactions were carried out on whole plasmid DNA . Only one runoff transcript was found to be dependent upon both AraC and CRP . In the absence of AraC protein a low level of a 125 base transcript was seen -LCB- Fig . 4 -RRB- . In the presence of saturating amounts of both activators , the same transcription product was increased fivefold . In the absence of CRP no 125 base product is made even in the presence of maximal AraC protein . The observed transcript runs off the right end of the linearized plasmid , as demonstrated by the reduction in the size of the product when the plasmid is cleaved at the HindIII site , reducing the size of the right end by 17 bp -LRB- Fig . 4 , lane 9 -RRB- . A 170 base transcript of unknown origin -LRB- marked x in Fig . 4 -RRB- is produced in the presence of RNA polymerase and only in the absence of CRP . The product originates from a region near the left end of the PFGH fragment and it terminates within the vector -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . It is not clear if this transcript is produced in vivo , and it is not always seen with in vitro reactions . -LRB- e -RRB- DNase footprint of the araFGH promoter The binding sites for the transcriptional activator proteins were located by DNase I protection assay . The araFGH DNA fragment of pWH54 was labeled on the bottom strand at the HindIII site , and the binding sites for AraC protein and CRP were determined -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . AraC protein protected two regons of approximately 40 bp each . One region extends from - 60 to - 103 , while the other is found at - 136 to - 178 . Since the function of these sites is not known , they have been designated araFG1 for the site centered at - 81 and araFG2 for the site at - 157 . At a low concentration of AraC protein the araFG2 site was fully occupied , while no protection of araFG1 was observed . This suggests that the affinity of FG2 for AraC protein is higher than the affinity of FG1 , which is opposite the relative affini - araFGH and araJ Promoters 503 AroC : CRP : 2.5 0.5 I - 5 3 - 0 0 - , 5 I - 5 5 - 0 3.0 - -- 2 '' 5 2 - 5 2 - 5 2 - 5 J m ' aFGH -LRB- Sinai -RRB- oroFGH -LRB- Hlndn ' r -RRB- RNAZ Figure 4 . Transcription in vitro from PF ~ H - Plasmid pWH54 was linearized by digestion with Sinai -LRB- site located in the vector 17 bp to the right of the HindIII site -RRB- , lanes 1 to 8 , or by digestion with HindIII , lane 9 . Single - round transcription reactions were performed in buffer containing cAMP and L - arabinose . Proteins were bound for l0 rain and transcription was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 ° C . All reactions contained 5 nM - RNA polymerase plus the indicated concentrations , given in nM - active protein , of CRP and AraC protein . ties of the ara02 and araI s -LRB- tes at PShD -LRB- Hendrickson & Schleif , 1984 -RRB- . A weak enhanced cleavage was seen at - 67 and strongly enhanced cleavage occurred at -- 77 and 98 . Similarly sized footprints were obtained for reactions performed with DNA labeled on the top strand -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- . AraC protection was from - 55 to - 100 and from - 136 to - 173 . Enhanced cleavage occurred at - 71 and - 92 in the FGI site and at - 133 , - 146 and - 167 in FG2 . The footprint of the FG2 site was obtained by labeling DNA at the AspT18 restriction site just upstream from FG2 , and the reaction products were analyzed on 20 % polyacrylamide gels -LRB- not shown -RRB- . Incubation of AraC protein with DNA in the absence of arabinose also produced a footprint identical with that seen in the presence of the sugar , although an increased amount of protein was required -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- b -RRB- , lane 10 -RRB- . The footprinting data are summarized in Figure 2 . CRP - cAMP protected a region of 22 bp of the bottom strand from - 32 to - 54 , and enhanced cleavage occurred at - 51 and - 52 -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . On the top strand 24 bp fl ' om - 29 to - 52 were protected , and cleavage at - 53 was strongly enhanced -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- . When both AraC and CRP were present , the entire region fl ' om - 29 to - 100 was protected . The region protected by CRP contains a sequence that matches the CRP consensus at 14 out of 22 positions including eight out of the ten most highly conserved bases -LRB- Berg & von Hippel , 1988 -RRB- . The CRP binding sequence is centered 41 '' 5 bp upstream from the araFGH tran - scriptional start , which places the right one - half of the site in the - 35 region of the promoter . -LRB- f -RRB- Transcription from the araJ promoter The transcription start point and relative amounts of cellular RNA produced by the promoter identified on plasmid pBEK9 were determined by SI nuclease mapping . I % NA was extracted from uninduced cells , cells induced by arabinose for various times , cells exposed to the anti - inducer D - fucose and arabinose - induced cells deleted of adenyl cyclase . Figure 6 shows the results of these assays , as well as a '' G '' sequencing reaction that was done on the same DNA to provide a size standard . Only one arabinose - induced hybrid to the bottom strand is apparent in the range of _ _ _ 125 bases of the possible transcription start points identified in vitro -LRB- Kosiba & Schleif , 1982 -RRB- . Hybridization to the other strand showed no evidence of an arabinose - induced transcript . The DNA fragments of the bottom strand protected by the hybridized RNA varied in size by seven bases . After correction of the 1.5 base migration velocity difference between $ 1 digested DNA and the chemically modified size standard DNA -LRB- Hentschel et al . , 1980 -RRB- , the fragments were seen to range in size from 156 to 163 bases . The various sizes of protected DNA might be thought to arise from incomplete S 1 digestion , but variation of the nuclease concentration from 15 to 40 units , a concentration that almost eliminated the protected504 W .

For numbering the nucleotides of the DNA , we take position l of the mRNA to correspond to a transcript of 161 bases . Such an assignment maximizes the similarity in sequence and position of this start site with other characterized start sites -LRB- Hawley & McClure , 1983 ; Harley & Reynolds , 1987 -RRB- . On the basis of the findings thati the promoter located on the chromosome produces an arabinose - regulated transcript in vivo , and that it is not at either the araE or araFGH loci , we name the promoter araPj and tentatively name the operon araJ . Figure 6 also shows that Pj is almost fully induced within two minutes of arabinose addition , and its induction increases only slightly over the next 150 minutes . Similar to the other ara operons , induction of Pj requires AraC protein , arabinose plus cAMP - CRP , and no induction is observed in cells incubated with the anti - inducer D - fucose . -LRB- g -RRB- Footprints of araP ~ The binding sites for AraC protein and CRP - cAMP complex were determined by DNase I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112 13 a - 40 '' - 20 - i ! . 20 - 40 '' 60 . 6 Figure 6 .

AATAGTGCTT TTATGAGGAA AATAGGCATC TTATGCCTAG Results and Discussion NarL piays a role at the nirB promoter : effects of a onebase - pair deletion The starting point of this work was a short DNA fragment . fuNy described by Beli et al . -LRB- 1990 -RRB- , carrying the nirB promoter region from base pairs - 150 to - H36 with respect to the transcription start , with an EcoRl linker cloned upstream of the transcnption start and a H / ndlll linker downstream . This fragment , illustrated in Fig . 1 , contains all the sequence information required for regulation . To monitor pnirB expression , the fragment was cloned into the low copy number , broad - host - range lac expression vector , pRW50 -LCB- Lodge et ai , 1992 -RRB- . In the resulting recombinant plasmid , pKTI , | 3 - galactosidase expression is controlled by pnirB : expression is induced during anaerobic growth conditions with optimal induction dependent on the presence of nitrite or nitrate . In previous work . Bell etai -LRB- 1990 -RRB- showed that the induction of pnirB by anaerobiosis and nitrite was unaffected by deletion of sequences upstream of position -- 83 -LRB- DR83 in Fig . 1 -RRB- . However deletions to base pairs - 68 and - 55 -LRB- DR68 and DR55 -RRB- led to loss of induction by nitrite -LRB- and nitrate -RRB- , although they did not abolish anaerobic induction since they fall outside the FNR - binding site -LRB- Fig . 1 -RRB- . The simplest explanation for this is that the DR68 and DR55 deletions destroy the binding site for some frans - acting factor necessary for nitrite / nitrate induction . To investigate this , we made a derivative of pnirB carrying a one - base - pair deletion at - 57 between the supposed nitrite / nitrate response element and the FNR - binding site -LRB- we had previously checked that a point mutation at - 57 had no effect on pnirB activity -RRB- . The DNA fragment carrying this new promoter . pnirBA57 , was cloned into the Alac expression plasmid , pRW50 , the resulting plasmid was transformed into the Alac host strain JCB387 and p - galactosidase expression was monitored during growth in a variety of conditions . Data in Fig . 2 confirm that expression from '' wild - type ' pnirB is induced by anaerobiosis and further stimulated by nitrite or nitrate . However , with pnirBA57 , although induction occurred in anaerobic conditions , no 2.500 2,000 - 1,500 - 1,000 - Fig . 2 . Effects of NarL on expression from pnirB and a derivative carrying a one - base - pair deletion . The bars illustrate p - galactosidase levels made in JCB387 -LRB- NarL * -RRB- or JCB3883 -LRB- NarL '' -RRB- cells carrying pKTI wifh lacZ expression controlled by pnirB or a derivative , pnirBA57 , with a one - basepair deletion at - 57 , Ceils were grown in different conditions as indicated in the inset to the figure . The Escherichia coli nirB promoter 153 further nitrite - dependent induction was apparent and nitrate caused a sharp decrease in expression . In a recent study . Page et ai -LRB- 1990 -RRB- showed that disruption of narL led to decreased expression from pnirB . To recheck the possible involvement of NarL factor , expression from pnirB and pnirBA57 was measured in strain JCB3883 . which is a narL derivative of JCB387 , Data in Fig . 2 confirm that the effect of the narL mutation is to decrease expression from pnirB in all conditions . With pnirBA57 , the sharp repression of activity by nitrate is relieved by disruption of narL . As a control for these experiments we also measured the effects of disrupting narL on expression from a semisynthetic FNR - dependent promoter in which the nirB FNR - binding site was ' transplanted ' into the E . coli meIR promoter . Expression from this promoter -LRB- F2pmelR D25X , described in Fig . 5 of Bell et ai , 1990 -RRB- is induced anaerobically but is not stimulated further by nitrite or nitrate and is unaffected by narL mutations -LRB- not shown -RRB- . Thus , the simplest explanation for the results in Fig . 2 is that NarL protein binds to a site upstream of - 57 and is , at least partially , responsible for nitrite and nitrate effects . Misplacing the NarL - binding site by one base pair stops induction and leads to NarL - dependent repression , presumably as the misplaced NarL interferes with FNR . Mutagenesis of a putative NarL - binding site Scrutiny of the pnirB sequence from - 83 to - 57 revealed an imperfect inverted repeat from position - 79 to - 60 which could be a site for a DNA - binding regulatory protein -LRB- Fig , 1 -RRB- , The two 10 bp motifs that make up this inverted repeat show similarities to elements in a 27 bp sequence located around - 200 at the narG promoter , that Li and DeMoss -LRB- 1988 -RRB- showed to be the NarL - binding site . Figure 1 shows that the narG sequence from - 207 to - 188 appears to be made up of a direct repeat of two similar 10 - base elements , whilst the nirB promoter from - 79 to - 60 carries an inverted repeat of related sequences . To investigate the significance of the nirB inverted repeat we made a number of base - pair changes using site - directed mutagenesis . In a first experiment we made a CG to G : C transversion at - 75 -LRB- p75G -RRB- , a G : C to C : G tranversion at - 64 -LCB- p64C -RRB- and the double mutation combining both changes -LRB- p64C p75G -RRB- . The changes are Illustrated in Fig . 1 : note that the two mutations are identical in the context of the inverted repeat , both being located at the fifth position of the 10 - base element . The results in Table 1 show that the two single mutations produce similar effects : they both cause a decrease in anaerobic levels of expression from pnirB , they abolish nitrite induction but have little effect on induction by nitrate . The effects of the single mutations are similar to the effects of disrupting narL However , combined together , the p75G and p64C mutations lead to a more severe decrease in pn / rSactivity in all conditions and prevent induction by both nitrite and nitrate . We next created transversions at the sixth position of the 10 - base element by making the mutations p74G -LRB- C : G to G : C at - 74 -RRB- and p65C -LRB- A : T to C : G at - 65 -RRB- -LRB- Fig . 1 -RRB- , The results in Table 1 show that the effect of these single changes is to decrease anaerobic induction both with and without nitrite , but , again , induction by nitrate is not suppressed . However , when combined , the p74G and p65C mutations suppress pnirB expression in alt conditions . The simplest interpretation of these results is that the nirB inverted repeat is recognized by two NarL subunits . and that NarL binding is needed for optimal pnirB expression both during growth in anaerobic conditions and during nitrite / nitrate induction . It is not clear why the p74G mutation has more severe effects than the p65C change . Interestingly , in the context of the nirB inverted repeat , the base at position 6 of the 10 - base element is not symmetric . We found that the transitions p65G and p74T had no effect on pnirB activity , suggesting that the binding factor can tolerate a pyrimidine but not a purine at position 6 of the 10 - base element . Effects of NarL - binding - site mutations in a narL background Although NarL was originally characterized as a factor essential for nitrate - induction of gene expression , disruption of narL does not completely stop nitrate induction of pnirB -LRB- Page et ai . 1990 , and Fig , 2 -RRB- , It is possible that cells contain a second transcription factor responding to nitrate , though , unlike NarL . this putative factor must be unable to respond to nitrite . We therefore investigated the effects of mutations at the fifth and sixth positions of the inverted repeat elements on pnirB expression in the absence of NarL , The results in Table 1 show that three of the four single mutations decrease NarL - independent stimulation of pnirB expression by nitrate . We conclude that any second factor is likely to bind to sequences similar to NarL , Note that the single and double mutations also reduce the FNR - dependent pnirB expression during anaerobic growth in the absence of externally added nitrite or nitrate , suggesting that both NarL and the second factor are needed for optimal anaerobically induced FNR - dependent transcription . A mutation in FNR that affects induction o / pnirB Since expression from pnirB is dependent on FNR in all growth conditions , it is possible that additional proteins , responsible for nitrite and nitrate induction , exert their effect by interacting with FNR . We therefore investigated the effects of known FNR mutations on nitrite and ' nitrate induction at pnirB . 154 K . L Tyson , A . I . Bell , J . A . Cole , andS . J . W .

Cells were grown in different conditions as shown in Ihe inset to the figure . The positive control mutation G85A -LRB- a giyoine to alanine change at position 85 -RRB- probably alters the ' patch ' on FNR that interacts with RNA polymerase and causes a sixfold reduction in anaerobically induced expression from the semi - synthetic FNR - dependent promoter F2pmelR D25X -LRB- Williams et ai , 1991 -RRB- . The results in Fig , 3 show that the G85A mutation in FNR has a smaller effect at pnirB , decreasing anaerobic expression twofold . However , further nitrite - or nitrate - dependent induction is almost totally suppressed , suggesting that NarL - dependent activation by nitrite or nitrate is mediated by FNR . The FNR * mutation D154A increases aerobic expression from the narGHJI promoter , probably by ' freezing ' FNR in an active conformation -LRB- Kiley and Reznikoff , 1991 -RRB- . Data in Fig . 3 show that the D154A mutation results in a twofold increase in aerobic expression from pn / / e whilst not altering induction by anaerobiosis , nitrite and nitrate . NarL binding sites at different promoters The similarities between the 10 - base sequence elements at both pnarG and pnirB , and the effects of pnirB point mutations , prompt us to propose that these elements contain the primary target for NarL monomers . Support for this comes from Dong et ai -LRB- 1992 -RRB- who showed that changes at positions 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 of narG box 1 -LRB- Fig . 4 -RRB- reduce induction of the narG promoter by nitrate . Interestingly , Berg et ai -LRB- 1991 -RRB- reported the sequence of another NarL - induced operon , fdnGHI , encoding the formate dehydrogenase complex that passes electrons to the narGHJ / nitrate reductase , Li and Stewart -LRB- 1992 -RRB- identified an inverted repeat in this sequence as the likely NarLbinding site , centred around position - 114 ; ^ upstream of the transcription start . The first six lines of Fig . 4 show that the 10 - base sequences upstream and downstream of this position are strikingly similar to the 10 - base sequences at pnarG and pnirB , suggesting that two NarL subunits might bind to an inverted repeat at the nirB and fdnGHI promoters , whilst , at pnarG , NarL binds to a direct repeat . This prompted us to search for similar sequences at other NarL - sensitive promoters in E . coli At the frdA promoter -LRB- Cole , 1982 -RRB- . where NarL acts as a repressor , we located two similar 10 - base sequences from - 9 to + ^ and from - nil to + 2 . Similarly at the dmsA promoter -LCB- Bilous etai , 1988 -RRB- , which is also repressed by NarL . we located three elements , which are listed in Fig . 4 , At the narK promoter , the sequence around - 200 contains elements similar to the pnarG NarL - binding sequence -LRB- Noji etai , 1989 ; Dong etai , 1992 -RRB- , which are also listed . The alignment of 13 sites shows perfect conservation of C at position 5 and the presence of a pyrimidine at position 6 , in accord with the mutational analyses of Table 1 . From the alignment , we suggest a minimal consensus 5 ' - * * TACY * KT * - 3 ' -LRB- Y - pyrlmidine ; K = A or C -RRB- , which was deduced using a rule that disallowed any more than one difference across the 13 sequences .

The striking feature of the sequence collation in Fig . 4 is that the position and organization of potential NarL - binding sites differs from one promoter to another . Presumably this reflects differences in the role of NarL at different regulatory regions . We do not understand why in some cases NarL binds to an inverted repeat whilst in others the target is a direct repeat , but this raises intriguing questions about NarL binding stoichiometries and co - operativity between subunits . One possibility is that the protein is monomeric and there are no interactions between bound subunits . Alternatively , the region between the DNA - binding domain and the aggregation ' patch ' might be flexible , allowing interactions between monomers bound in different configurations . Note that there is a precedent for this sort of flexibility with proteins of the AraC family -LRB- Ramos et ai , 1990 -RRB- and E . coii TyrR -LRB- Pittard and Davidson , 1991 -RRB- . Two - step activation of transcription at pnirB . some conciusicns Sequence analysis of NarL shows that it is the ' regulator ' half of a two - component system that , by analogy with other members of this class , should bind to target DNA via a helix - turn - helix motif near the C - terminus -LRB- reviewed by Gross et ai , 1989 -RRB- . Taken together , our results suggest that NarL protein binds to an inverted repeat from positions - 79 to - 60 at pnirB . Unfortunately , we can not prove this point since , to our knowledge , no one , as yet , has reported NarL binding to DNA targets in vitro and our efforts to date have been abortive . At pnirB , NarL appears to be essential for nitrite induction of expression , since mutation of narL or alteration of the putative binding site suppresses nitrite effects . In contrast , we found clear nitrate - dependent induction in a narL background , suggesting that there might be a second factor responding to nitrate . This observation complicates the interpretation of our data and , although likely , we have no proof that NarL is directly responsible for nitrate induction of pnirB . Surprisingly , suppression of nitrate induction requires two symmetry - related mutations in the NarL - binding site , whilst nitrite induction is suppressed by one mutation . We can not be sure whether this is due to the second nitrate stimulatory factor or whether the binding properties of NarL differ according to whether it is triggered by nitrate or nitrite . The effects of changes in the NarL - binding site on anaerobic induction from pnirB in the absence of nitrite or nitrate were surprising . We had assumed that an intact FNR - binding site would be sufficient for this induction and yet removal of NarL , either by disrupting the gene or altering the target , leads to clear decreases in anaerobic expression . This result shows that NarL is ' active ' in the absence of extracellular nitrate or nitrite and suggests that FNR needs a ' helper ' when in the context of the nirB promoter . NarL appears to play different roles at the nirB and narG promoters . At the narG promoter , NarL binds far upstream of the transcription start and requires integration host factor , which probably bends the intervening DNA and helps NarL ' reach ' downstream : there is some evidence that NarL can directly contact RNA polymerase , since NarL - dependent activation can be detected in an fnr mutant -LRB- Walker and DeMoss , 1991 ; Rabin ef ai , 1992 -RRB- . In contrast , at the nirB promoter , NarL binds adjacent to FNR . FNR - independent expression is minimal , and the simplest explanation for the results is that NarL interacts with FNR : we suppose that the G85A change in FNR alters the conformation ol FNR to interfere with this interaction . Current models of how FNR activates transcription -LRB- based mainly on in vitro studies with the cyclic AMP receptor protein , GRP , a related activator -RRB- envisage that the DNA wraps around the FNR , resulting in a contact between RNA polymerase and sequences upstream of bound FNR -LRB- Busby , 1992 -RRB- . It is possible that NarL , which also binds to this upstream region , is necessary to help ' set up ' this interaction . At semi - synthetic FNR - dependent promoters -LRB- such as F2pmelR D25X . see Bell et al . , 1990 -RRB- an FNR - site alone is sufficient for efficient FNR - dependent transcription activation .

Bell etai -lrb- 1990 -rrb- show that the induction of pnirb by anaerobiosis and nitrite be unaffected by deletion of sequence upstream of position -- 83 -lrb- dr83 in fig . 1 -rrb- . however deletion to base pair - 68 and - 55 -lrb- dr68 and dr55 -rrb- lead to loss of induction by nitrite -lrb- and nitrate -rrb- , although they do not abolish anaerobic induction since they fall outside the fnr - bind site -lrb- fig . 1 -rrb- . the simplest explanation for this be that the dr68 and dr55 deletion destroy the binding site for some fran - act factor necessary for nitrite / nitrate induction . to investigate this , we make a derivative of pnirb carry a one - base - pair deletion at - 57 between the suppose nitrite / nitrate response element and the fnr - bind site -lrb- we have previously check that a point mutation at - 57 have no effect on pnirb activity -rrb- . the dna fragment carry this new promoter . pnirba57 , be clone into the alac expression plasmid , prw50 , the result plasmid be transform into the Alac host strain jcb387 and p - galactosidase expression be monitor during growth in a variety of condition . datum in fig . 2 confirm that expression from '' wild - type ' pnirb be induce by anaerobiosis and further stimulate by nitrite or nitrate . however , with pnirba57 , although induction occur in anaerobic condition , no 2.500 2,000 - 1,500 - 1,000 - fig . 2 . effect of narl on expression from pnirb and a derivative carry a one - base - pair deletion . the bar illustrate p - galactosidase level make in jcb387 -lrb- narl * -rrb- or jcb3883 -lrb- narl '' -rrb- cell carry pkti wifh lacz expression control by pnirb or a derivative , pnirba57 , with a one - basepair deletion at - 57 , ceil be grow in different condition as indicate in the inset to the figure . the escherichia coli nirb promoter 153 further nitrite - dependent induction be apparent and nitrate cause a sharp decrease in expression . in a recent study . Page et be -lrb- 1990 -rrb- show that disruption of narl lead to decrease expression from pnirb . to recheck the possible involvement of narl factor , expression from pnirb and pnirba57 be measure in strain jcb3883 . which be a narl derivative of jcb387 , datum in fig . 2 confirm that the effect of the narl mutation be to decrease expression from pnirb in all condition . with pnirba57 , the sharp repression of activity by nitrate be relieve by disruption of narl . as a control for these experiment we also measure the effect of disrupt narl on expression from a semisynthetic fnr - dependent promoter in which the nirB fnr - bind site be ' transplant ' into the e . coli meir promoter . expression from this promoter -lrb- f2pmelr d25x , describe in fig . 5 of Bell et be , 1990 -rrb- be induce anaerobically but be not stimulate further by nitrite or nitrate and be unaffected by narl mutation -lrb- not show -rrb- . thus , the simplest explanation for the result in fig . 2 be that narl protein bind to a site upstream of - 57 and be , at least partially , responsible for nitrite and nitrate effect . misplace the narl - bind site by one base pair stop induction and lead to narl - dependent repression , presumably as the misplace narl interfere with fnr . mutagenesis of a putative narl - bind site scrutiny of the pnirb sequence from - 83 to - 57 reveal a imperfect inverted repeat from position - 79 to - 60 which could be a site for a dna - bind regulatory protein -lrb- fig , 1 -rrb- , the two 10 bp motif that make up this inverted repeat show similarity to element in a 27 bp sequence located around - 200 at the narg promoter , that Li and DeMoss -lrb- 1988 -rrb- show to be the narl - bind site . Figure 1 show that the narg sequence from - 207 to - 188 appear to be make up of a direct repeat of two similar 10 - base element , whilst the nirb promoter from - 79 to - 60 carry a inverted repeat of related sequence . to investigate the significance of the nirb inverted repeat we make a number of base - pair change use site - directed mutagenesis . in a first experiment we make a cg to g : c transversion at - 75 -lrb- p75g -rrb- , a g : c to c : g tranversion at - 64 -lcb- p64c -rrb- and the double mutation combine both change -lrb- p64c p75g -rrb- . the change be Illustrated in Fig . 1 : note that the two mutation be identical in the context of the inverted repeat , both be located at the fifth position of the 10 - base element . the result in Table 1 show that the two single mutation produce similar effect : they both cause a decrease in anaerobic level of expression from pnirb , they abolish nitrite induction but have little effect on induction by nitrate . the effect of the single mutation be similar to the effect of disrupt narL however , combine together , the p75g and p64c mutation lead to a more severe decrease in pn / rsactivity in all condition and prevent induction by both nitrite and nitrate . we next create transversion at the sixth position of the 10 - base element by make the mutation p74g -lrb- c : g to g : c at - 74 -rrb- and p65c -lrb- a : t to c : g at - 65 -rrb- -lrb- fig . 1 -rrb- , the result in Table 1 show that the effect of these single change be to decrease anaerobic induction both with and without nitrite , but , again , induction by nitrate be not suppress . however , when combine , the p74g and p65c mutation suppress pnirb expression in alt condition . the simplest interpretation of these result be that the nirb inverted repeat be recognize by two narl subunit . and that narl binding be need for optimal pnirb expression both during growth in anaerobic condition and during nitrite / nitrate induction . it be not clear why the p74g mutation have more severe effect than the p65c change . interestingly , in the context of the nirb inverted repeat , the base at position 6 of the 10 - base element be not symmetric . we find that the transition p65g and p74t have no effect on pnirb activity , suggest that the binding factor can tolerate a pyrimidine but not a purine at position 6 of the 10 - base element . effect of narl - binding - site mutation in a narl background although narl be originally characterize as a factor essential for nitrate - induction of gene expression , disruption of narl do not completely stop nitrate induction of pnirb -lrb- Page et be . 1990 , and fig , 2 -rrb- , it be possible that cell contain a second transcription factor respond to nitrate , though , unlike narl . this putative factor must be unable to respond to nitrite . we therefore investigate the effect of mutation at the fifth and sixth position of the inverted repeat element on pnirb expression in the absence of narl , the result in Table 1 show that three of the four single mutation decrease narl - independent stimulation of pnirb expression by nitrate . we conclude that any second factor be likely to bind to sequence similar to narl , note that the single and double mutation also reduce the fnr - dependent pnirb expression during anaerobic growth in the absence of externally add nitrite or nitrate , suggest that both narl and the second factor be need for optimal anaerobically induce fnr - dependent transcription . a mutation in fnr that affect induction o / pnirB since expression from pnirb be dependent on fnr in all growth condition , it be possible that additional protein , responsible for nitrite and nitrate induction , exert they effect by interact with fnr . we therefore investigate the effect of known fnr mutation on nitrite and ' nitrate induction at pnirb . 154 K .

Rabin ef be , 1992 -rrb- . in contrast , at the nirb promoter , narl bind adjacent to fnr . fnr - independent expression be minimal , and the simplest explanation for the result be that narl interact with fnr : we suppose that the g85a change in fnr alter the conformation ol fnr to interfere with this interaction . current model of how fnr activate transcription -lrb- base mainly on in vitro study with the cyclic amp receptor protein , grp , a related activator -rrb- envisage that the dna wrap around the FNR , result in a contact between rna polymerase and sequence upstream of bind fnr -lrb- Busby , 1992 -rrb- . it be possible that narl , which also bind to this upstream region , be necessary to help ' set up ' this interaction . at semi - synthetic fnr - dependent promoter -lrb- such as f2pmelr d25x . see Bell et al . , 1990 -rrb- a fnr - site alone be sufficient for efficient fnr - dependent transcription activation . however , at pnirb , the promoter context appear to impose the necessity of a upstream factor for efficient fnr activity . there be a156 k . l Tyson , A .

Based on the map positions of the Tn5 insertions and the direction of transcription determined from the Mu dl1734 operon fusions , we assign the gene order fdnCHI -LRB- Figure 2 -RRB- . We did not observe any polar effects of the Tn5 insertions in fdnCHI . Indeed , previous work indicates dependent promoters . To do this , we cloned the that T7 RNA polymerase does not recognize many E . highly polar R interposon -LRB- PRENTKI and KRISCH 1984 -RRB- coli transcription terminators -LRB- DUNN and STUDIER 1983 ; JENC , GARDNER and GUMPORT 1990 ; STUDIER and MOFFATT 1986 ; TABOR and RICHARDSON 1985 -RRB- .

Q , which confers resistance to spectinomycin , contains strong transcription terminators at each of its ends . We transduced fdn - G119 : : Q into three strains which contained @ vanlacZ -RRB- operon fusions . If fdnH and fdnI expression is due to transcription that initiates upstream of fdnG , we would expect operon fusions located downstream of the Q element to be silent due to polarity -LRB- CIAMPI and ROTH 1988 -RRB- . fdnGl19 : : Q had no effect on expression of the upstream operon fusion formed by fdn - G108 : : Mu dl1 734 . By contrast , fdnGll9 : : Q abolished expression from the downstream operon fusions formed by fdnIl03 : : Mu dl1734 and fdnIl02 : : Mu dl1 734 .

Transcription activation of the nitrate reductase structural gene operon -LRB- narGHJI -RRB- requires the FNR protein for induction by anaerobiosis and the NarL protein for induction by nitrate -LRB- STEWART 1982 -RRB- . Since @ -LRB- $ dnG - lacZ -RRB- was also induced anaerobically by nitrate -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- , we reasoned that induction of fdnGHZ might also be mediated by FNR and NarL . To test this , we examined expression of @ udnG - lacZ -RRB- in strains which contained transposon insertions in fnr and narL . For comparison , we also measured induction of @ -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- . fnr - 21 : : TnlO abolished anaerobic induction of both @ udnG - lacZ -RRB- and @ -LRB- narc - lacZ -RRB- and narL215 : : TnlO prevented induction by nitrate -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- .
