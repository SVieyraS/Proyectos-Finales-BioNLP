In every case , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- bound as well as or more tightly -LRB- i . e . , had a lower K D -LSB- equilibrium dissociation constant -RRB- than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from > > 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from > > 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW -LRB- Table 3 and Fig . 1 -RRB- . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution -LRB- less than 1.7 - fold -RRB- . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by > 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA -LRB- with aTatposition 12 -RRB- indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position -LRB- 36 -RRB- , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue -LRB- see the Discussion for a fuller treatment -RRB- . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation -LRB- see above -RRB- . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- -LRB- with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89G -RRB- -LRB- with no side chain -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89D -RRB- -LRB- with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89V -RRB- -LRB- with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , -RRB- , WT SoxS , and SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- were introduced into these fusions and assayed for β - galactosidase . Again -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA -LRB- Fig . 3 -RRB- . Similarly , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive -LRB- indistinguishable from the control plasmid -RRB- for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- was still more active than WT MarA . -LRB- The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in Table 2 appear smaller . -RRB- As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , -LRB- i -RRB- that variant E89D is virtually inactive , -LRB- ii -RRB- that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , -LRB- iii -RRB- that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and -LRB- iv -RRB- that SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated -LRB- see Materials and Methods -RRB- . Again -LRB- Fig . 2 and Table 3 -RRB- , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox -LRB- Fig . 4 -RRB- . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 -LRB- Fig . 4A and B -RRB- . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA -LRB- Fig . 4B -RRB- . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream -LRB- between positions 9 and 10 -RRB- was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed -LRB- Fig . 4 -RRB- although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels -LRB- Table 2 ; see also below -RRB- . For the nine class II promoters , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - -LRB- Q91 -RRB- has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence -LRB- 36 -RRB- . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site -LRB- Q85 -RRB- in SoxS -LRB- 16 -RRB- . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- relative to MarA -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- to the micF marbox -LRB- using protein without the His 6 tag -RRB- showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- to activate the class II micF promoter -LRB- 13 -RRB- . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate -LRB- PMS -RRB- and menadione -LRB- Table 4 -RRB- . Cells constitutively expressing MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS -LRB- 1.7 - fold -RRB- and , to a lesser extent , to menadione -LRB- 1.3 - fold -RRB- . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS -LRB- MIC of 35 μM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA -RRB- but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione -LRB- MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT -RRB- . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant -LRB- acrAB , tolC , and micF -RRB- and that defend against superoxide stress -LRB- e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf -RRB- -LRB- 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 -RRB- . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated -LRB- 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 -RRB- . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure -LRB- Fig . 5 -RRB- shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the β - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small `` clash '' -LRB- as predicted by the MolProbity program -LSB- http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / -RSB- -RRB- between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone .	in every case , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- bind as well as or more tightly -lrb- i . e . , have a lower k d -lsb- equilibrium dissociation constant -rrb- than wt mara . for several promoter marbox this change be dramatic : the k d drop from > > 150 to 50 for inaa , from 200 to 75 for nfsb , and from > > 150 nm to ~ 100 nm for both ybjc and yhbw . in spite of this , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- activation be greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjc ; it be comparable to that of WT MarA for micf and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdab , nfsb , and ybhw -lrb- Table 3 and fig . 1 -rrb- . we conclude that the WT glutamic acid of mara at position 89 be a inhibitor of mara binding to many marbox . in a effort to understand why e89 be inhibitory , we examine the sequence of the 14 marbox for which we have datum -lrb- Table 3 -rrb- . we notice that five haveatatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequence be increase by the e89a substitution -lrb- less than 1.7 - fold -rrb- . in contrast , of the remain nine sequence that do not have atatthis position , the binding of e89a be increase for six of they by > 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increase binding . although the cocrystal structure of mara with the marrab marbox dna -lrb- with atatposition 12 -rrb- indicate no interaction between the two molecule at this position -lrb- 36 -rrb- , we consider the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox dna and mara could limit activation by mara when position 12 be not a t residue -lrb- see the discussion for a fuller treatment -rrb- . to examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of e89 sterically inhibit interaction with marbox dna lack atatposition 12 , we test the effect of several amino acid substitution at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacz fusion and the mdtg : : lacz fusion , the two fusion that show the greatest effect of e89a on activation -lrb- see above -rrb- . Plasmids carry WT MarA , the mara variant mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- -lrb- with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89g -rrb- -lrb- with no side chain -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89d -rrb- -lrb- with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89v -rrb- -lrb- with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of soxs and have a dimethyl methylene side chain , -rrb- , wt soxs , and soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- be introduce into these fusion and assay for β - galactosidase . Again -lrb- Table 2 -rrb- , activation of these promoter by soxs be much greater than that by mara -lrb- fig . 3 -rrb- . similarly , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- be considerably more active than wt mara . in contrast , the e89d variant be less active than wt mara for fpr and completely inactive -lrb- indistinguishable from the control plasmid -rrb- for mdtg . e89g be approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtg although for both promoter it be considerably less active than e89a . the e89v variant be marginally more active than the WT for both promoter but substantially less so than e89a . soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- reduce the activation of these promoter relative to wt soxs , but soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- be still more active than wt mara . -lrb- the activation show here be greater than those apparent in Table 2 because the expression of the plasmid carry mara , soxs , and they mutant be not entirely shut off by laci q so that the increase express in Table 2 appear smaller . -rrb- as outline in the Discussion , these result , namely , -lrb- i -rrb- that variant e89d be virtually inactive , -lrb- ii -rrb- that e89g be very active although to a lesser extent than e89a , -lrb- iii -rrb- that e89v be only marginally more active than the WT , and -lrb- iv -rrb- that soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- have reduce activation although not to the low level express by WT MarA , be consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of e89 sterically inhibit interaction with the dna for marbox sequence lack atat position 12 . if , as outline above and present in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between position 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 be responsible for the very poor activation of promoter such as fpr , then it would be predict that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhance if that phosphate be absent . we therefore compare the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - strand dna contain the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsdna of the same sequence and length but prepare so that the phosphate linkage between position 12 and 13 of the marbox be eliminate -lrb- see Materials and method -rrb- . Again -lrb- Fig . 2 and Table 3 -rrb- , mara bind very poorly to the fpr marbox -lrb- fig . 4 -rrb- . however , binding increase significantly when the fpr dna lack the phosphate group between position 12 and 13 -lrb- fig . 4a and b -rrb- . in contrast , soxs bind more tightly to dsdna than to the discontinuous dna -lrb- fig . 4b -rrb- . when the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream -lrb- between position 9 and 10 -rrb- be absent , no significant alteration in binding be observe -lrb- fig . 4 -rrb- although a small increase be observe when the phosphate between position 15 and 16 be absent . we conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibit the ability of mara to bind . activation and marbox binding by mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- . the only other mara mutation find here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class i promoter be q91a -lrb- Table 2 -rrb- . of the seven class i promoter examine , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- activate the acrab , marrab , and zwf promoter to similar extent as WT MarA but activate acna , fpr , mdtg , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT level -lrb- Table 2 ; see also below -rrb- . for the nine class ii promoter , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- significantly reduce the activation of fumc , inaa , micf , pqia , and ybjc but have no significant effect on nfsb , mdab , soda , oryhbw . mara - -lrb- q91 -rrb- have be identify as form van der waals interaction with the methyl group of the two thymidine that be complementary to the adenine at position 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence -lrb- 36 -rrb- . thus , it would be expect that the q91a substitution might reduce activation of the seven class ii promoter that have at least one a at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoter , nfsb and soda , that have no a residue at these position . indeed , nfsb and soda be among the promoter that q91a activate to the same extent as WT MarA . since q91a reduce the expression of four of the seven class i promoter and four of the nine class ii promoter , we result be inconsistent with the proposition that q91 be principally require for interaction at class ii promoter , as have be propose for the analogous site -lrb- q85 -rrb- in soxs -lrb- 16 -rrb- . for the majority of these promoter , the gel mobility assay for binding of mara to marbox be insufficiently precise to determine whether there be a correlation between binding and activation by mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- relative to mara -lrb- Table 3 -rrb- . among the class i promoter that exhibit measurable binding to mara , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- show no greater binding or activation for acrab , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtg and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marrab . a modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation be see for the class ii mdab promoter . although not observe in these experiment , a more detailed analysis of the binding of mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- to the micf marbox -lrb- use protein without the he 6 tag -rrb- show a very small reduction in bind concomitant with the reduce ability of mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- to activate the class ii micf promoter -lrb- 13 -rrb- . thus , relative to mara , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for q91a at class i promoter , but none be obvious with regard to the class ii promoter . activation of superoxide resistance by mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- . if the glutamic acid at position 89 of mara be a major determinant in vivo of the reduce activity of mara at many promoter where soxs be more active , we would expect cell carry mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- to be more resistant to superoxide than cell carry WT MarA . this be test with gradient plate assay of sensitivity to two superoxide - generate compound , phenazine methosulfate -lrb- pms -rrb- and menadione -lrb- Table 4 -rrb- . cell constitutively express mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- be more resistant than wt mara to pms -lrb- 1.7 - fold -rrb- and , to a lesser extent , to menadione -lrb- 1.3 - fold -rrb- . comparable mic with soxs for pm be 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . clearly , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- activate superoxide resistance to a greater extent than wt mara . curiously , the q91a substitution have no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator pms -lrb- mic of 35 μm for both the q91a mutant and the WT MarA -rrb- but lower resistance to the superoxide generator menadione -lrb- mic of 0.9 mm for the q91a mutant and 1.8 mm for the WT -rrb- . discussion . the mara - soxs - Rob regulon of e . coli consist of a variety of gene that enable cell to adapt to multiple stress . it contain gene that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant -lrb- acrab , tolc , and micf -rrb- and that defend against superoxide stress -lrb- e . g . , acna , fpr , fumc , nfsa , soda , and zwf -rrb- -lrb- 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 -rrb- . not surprisingly , there be quantitative difference in the extent of activation of particular promoter by the paralogous activator so that the phenotypic outcome depend on which activator be upregulate -lrb- 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 -rrb- . e89 inhibition . we have show here that the mara glutamic acid residue e89 be responsible for decrease the binding of WT MarA relative to soxs for the class i marbox promoter , acna , mdtg , fpr , and zwf , thereby decrease the relative activation of these promoter and hence the resistance engender to superoxide by mara . we think the follow may explain these result . a detail of the mara structure -lrb- fig . 5 -rrb- show that e89 be orient in the cocrystal with its acidic group expose to the solvent away from the dna backbone . in so do , methyl hydrogen on the β - and - carbon be positioned restrictively close to a oxygen of the phosphate group between basis t12 and g13 of the marrab marbox . even this orientation of e89 be only possible as the result of a small `` clash '' -lrb- as predict by the MolProbity program -lsb- http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / -rsb- -rrb- between e89 and s90 that permit the rotation of e89 into the mara core and away from the dna backbone .
